        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My love for Psychology started at a very young age. I was born on December 26 2000 to a wonderful Christian couple. I started becoming very self aware at a young age. I wanted to learn more about why I, personally, act in some ways. I wanted to know the deeper meaning of every reaction that I had and where the initial response was coming from. If something made me scared, I wanted to know why. I grew up in Cairo, Egypt where I observed a lot. I was an only child. In school, I used to observe all my classmates as well. Just like in every movie, there were the mean girls, the girls that everyone loved but were not popular, the girls that were popular, the shy girls, and so on. I hoped from friend group to friend group taking in the different life experiences and different personalities that I had come across. <br><br>

        I started to realize that most people are not just born mean, they get hurt along the way. I also realized that some people can be fake very easily, while others could not lie to save their lives. It grew an even bigger fascination in me as I came to the states. I spoke no english, which only aided in my observation of my classmates and American adults. As I continued to grow up I started really thinking about pursuing a Psychology degree in college. The people around pushed me toward that too. Fast Forward now to college, I attend UC Riverside pursuing a BA in Psychology. I have finished all my lower division Psych courses and my interest is only growing more and more. This led to me growing a hobby of researching true crime. I have had that hobby for about 4 years and have researched many cases. This hobby has also been fascinating, since I get to observe the decisions and the minds of serial killers, and try to understand the science behind why it is different from the common man. I can now understand the different mental disorders and what those lead to.<br><br>

        For the next step, I am looking to graduate college and become a counselor for kids. I believe that the most important years for developing re earlier than we think and I want to aid the next generation in any way possible. This could just be for me to help make a kid feel heard, or to actually walk them through very hard experiences that life brought on them. This love for kids started because of my own family. I have many younger cousins that I constantly had to babysit. Kids are usually an image of purity, but when life hits there actions and attitudes can change very quickly. This is why I am determined to work hard and open my own family practice. A huge part of the practice will be counseling children. I had not yet been a part of any internships or psychology related clubs, but I am now halfway to getting my degree.
